# Mocker

A FastAPI service that generates realistic, schema-valid mock data from internal FastAPI endpoints. Point your tests at Mocker instead of the real service — no test code changes required.

## Architecture

    A[POST /mock] --> B[parser/\nfetch + resolve schema]
    B --> C[generator/\nproduce fake data]
    C --> D[JSON response]
```

## The Problem

Writing mock fixtures by hand is tedious and drifts from the real schema over time. Mocker reads the OpenAPI schema directly from your service and generates realistic fake responses automatically.

**Before** — your tests call the real service (or you maintain hand-rolled mocks):
```python
response = httpx.get("http://user-service/users/abc-123")
```

**After** — point `BASE_URL` at Mocker. No other changes:
```python
response = httpx.get("http://localhost:8080/mock")  # returns fake but schema-valid data
```

## Getting Started

```bash
make install      # install dependencies
make run          # start the API (port 8080)
make run-reload   # start with auto-reload (dev)

# Docker
make docker-build  # build image tagged mocker:<git-sha>
make docker-run    # run container on port 8080

# Helm / Helmfile
make helm-dev         # deploy to development
make helm-staging     # deploy to staging
make helm-production  # deploy to production
make helm-diff ENV=staging     # dry-run diff
make helm-destroy ENV=staging  # tear down a release
```

## Endpoints

|Endpoint|Method|Description|
|--------|------|-----------|
|`/mock/schema`|`POST`|Generate mock data from an OpenAPI schema URL or registered app name|
|`/mock/sample`|`POST`|Regenerate fake data from a caller-provided response dict|
|`/health`|`GET`|Service health — `{"status": "ok"}`|
|`/healthz`|`GET`|Kubernetes liveness probe — `{}`|
|`/ready`|`GET`|Kubernetes readiness probe — `{}`|

## Usage

Use `schema_url` to point at any OpenAPI schema, or `app_name` for a registered well-known service. If both are given, `schema_url` wins.

```bash
# by schema URL
POST /mock/schema
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "schema_url": "http://user-service/openapi.json",
  "endpoint": "/users/{id}",
  "method": "GET"
}

# by app name (resolves to registered schema URL)
POST /mock/schema
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "app_name": "user-service",
  "endpoint": "/users/{id}",
  "method": "GET"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "a3f2c1d0-...",
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
    "region": "EMEA",
    "status": "active",
    "owner": {
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
    }
  },
  "status_code": 200,
  "mocked_from": "http://user-service/openapi.json"
}
```

Mocker fetches the OpenAPI schema from `schema_url`, resolves all `$ref` pointers, and returns a fake but structurally valid response for the requested endpoint and method.

Field values are generated with the following priority:
1. **Enum** — if the schema defines allowed values, one is picked at random (works with inline enums and FastAPI's nullable `anyOf` pattern)
2. **Semantic hints** — field names like `email`, `iban`, `name`, `region` produce realistic values via Faker
3. **Type-based** — fallback generation for `string`, `integer`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`

## Running Tests

```bash
make test

# Single file
uv run pytest tests/unit/parser/test_parser.py

# Single test
uv run pytest -k "test_parse_route_returns_route_definition"
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Phase 1 — Parser: fetch OpenAPI schema, resolve `$ref`s, extract `RouteDefinition`
- [x] Phase 2 — Generator: walk `RouteDefinition` and produce fake data (Faker + semantic hints for `email`, `iban`, `region`, `ecosystem`, etc.)
- [x] Phase 3 — API: `POST /mock` endpoint wiring parser + generator
- [x] Phase 3.5 — Health endpoints: `GET /health`, `GET /healthz`, `GET /ready`
- [x] Phase 4 — Schema caching: `@lru_cache` on `fetch_schema`, `TestSettings` as test constant source
- [x] Phase 5 — Dockerize: multi-stage `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` + `make docker-build/run`
- [x] Phase 6 — Helm + Helmfile: `deploy/` chart (`Deployment`, `Service`, `ConfigMap`, `Ingress`); Helmfile for dev/staging/production overlays; `COMMIT_SHA` flows from Makefile to image tag
- [x] Phase 7 — Sample-based mocking: `POST /mock/sample` accepts a real response dict and regenerates fake data from its shape; `POST /mock` renamed to `POST /mock/schema`
- [ ] Phase 8 — Stub server: mirror all routes from a target service (drop-in replacement mode)
- [ ] Phase 9 — Service catalog + pre-generated mock store: background worker fetches schemas and pre-generates mock data for registered services into a DB; `app_name + endpoint + method` becomes a DB lookup (replaces static `APP_REGISTRY`); live `schema_url` path remains for ad-hoc use
